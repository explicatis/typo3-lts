# TYPO3 LTS metapackage

Restrict versions of TYPO3 packages to a common constraint when using Composer Mode. Inspired by [symfony/lts](https://github.com/symfony/lts).

To use, just `composer require explicatis/typo3-lts "^8"` in your Composer-based TYPO3 project to restrict all TYPO3 
packages to the 8.7 LTS version. Use `"^9"` for 9.5 LTS and so on.
